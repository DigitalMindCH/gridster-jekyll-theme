## Multimedia
If we had to choose one word to describe Gridster that would be it. Gridster is a theme that focusses on multimedia. It contains different post types to create video posts, audio posts, image post or gallery posts with ease. We created a ton of Variables, that make customization super easy.

This theme is powerful and it comes with a few extras. It also comes with a lot of different layouts for you and in pretty material design.

## Features
The theme comes with a grunt file, which means that working with it is super easy. We have Tasks that compile, concatenate, minify and even deploy to your site.

### Extensive Documentation
We don't believe in delivering Code without explanation. So we wrote an extensive Documentation for Gridster that goes over every single step from installing all of the dependencies to explaining how to customize, create posts and publish. We even tell you how you can host Gridster with Plugins on GitHub pages.

Check the [Docs](http://gridster.digitalmind.ch/documentation/) out.

### Feedback, Wishes, Problems
